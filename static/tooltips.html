        <div class="coach-text">
            The UTC Clock shows coordinated universal time for all mission and diagnostic timestamps. UTC is used to avoid timezone and daylight-saving ambiguity when correlating logs, telemetry, and events across devices. The display follows a 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS) with a “Z” suffix where applicable, and may include date for long sessions. Time is synchronized from the navigation stack (e.g., GPS/NTP) when available; if sync is temporarily unavailable, the clock continues from the system time until the next update. Use this value when reporting incidents, annotating screenshots, or cross-checking sensor records, regardless of local time settings elsewhere in the interface.

            The Attention Indicators group displays the current status of key onboard systems such as engine, propulsion, fuel, oil temperature, oil pressure, autopilot, and manual control input. Each icon reflects the real-time condition of its subsystem through color and activation state. White or dimmed icons indicate normal operation, yellow signals a value that requires operator attention, and red denotes a fault or critical condition that demands immediate response. Active elements use bright illumination to confirm sensor activity or fault detection. The group provides a compact situational summary, allowing the operator to assess overall vessel health at a glance without opening detailed panels.

            The Satellite Numbers readout shows GNSS reception quality at a glance. Values indicate satellites in view and satellites used for the current fix, aggregated across supported constellations (e.g., GPS, GLONASS, Galileo). A stable 3D fix typically requires ≥4 satellites in use; higher counts improve positional stability and reduce drift. Color logic: white (neutral) indicates adequate reception for navigation; yellow signals degraded geometry or borderline satellite count (expect increased position noise); red denotes loss of reliable fix or insufficient satellites. Green is used only when the system confirms a “good” state, such as a high satellite count with verified 3D fix and healthy dilution-of-precision.

            The Coordinate Values display the vessel’s current latitude (LAT) and longitude (LNG) in decimal degrees. These readings are updated in real time from the navigation subsystem and represent the precise position of the active GNSS antenna. Coordinates use the WGS-84 reference system and follow a fixed six-decimal format for clarity and interoperability with mapping and mission-planning tools. Values remain visible even when the vessel is stationary or awaiting a navigation fix. If satellite data becomes temporarily unavailable, the last valid coordinates are held until the next update. Use these values for position logging, reporting, and cross-checking with chart or telemetry data.

        <div class="coach-title">Active Helm Gauge</div>
        <div class="coach-text">
            The Active Helm Gauge is the central visual element of the control interface, designed to reflect the real-time behavior of the vessel’s steering system. Its circular layout echoes the shape of a physical helm and provides immediate visual feedback for both manual and autopilot modes.

            The pointer moves smoothly along a calibrated scale from –35 to +35 degrees, mirroring the current rudder angle with precise motion and minimal latency. A neutral zero-position line marks the vessel’s straight-ahead course, allowing operators to assess steering offset at a glance.

            In manual mode, the gauge responds directly to helm input, updating continuously as the pilot adjusts the wheel or joystick. When the autopilot is engaged, the gauge switches to follow commanded values received from the navigation system, while still displaying live sensor data beneath. This dual-layer logic ensures full situational awareness and prevents data gaps between control modes.

        <div class="coach-title">AP Status</div>
        <div class="coach-text">
            The AP Status indicator reports the current state of the autopilot subsystem and its readiness to accept helm commands. It aggregates command, mode, and health signals to give a single, unambiguous status for the operator.
                
            AP Status can be DISENGAGED (Manual), STANDBY, or ENGAGED. When engaged, the active control mode is shown as a short label (e.g., HDG, CTS/TRK, WPT, or HOLD). If no valid mode is available, the indicator falls back to STANDBY. The component subscribes to commanded values from the navigation stack and to feedback from the steering sensors. If the commanded mode and the feedback disagree beyond thresholds, AP Status escalates from ENGAGED to ATTENTION and can raise a FAULT if limits are exceeded or data is stale.
                
            Operator interactions are explicit. Toggling the Helm control from Manual to Autopilot sets STANDBY first; only a confirmed mode selection (e.g., HDG) moves the state to ENGAGED. Any manual wheel override, sensor dropout, or invalid course input drops the state back to STANDBY with a brief cause code. On startup, AP Status initializes to DISENGAGED (Manual) until both command and feedback streams are valid. On shutdown or link loss, it returns to Manual and clears all mode labels to avoid stale presentation.

            The Speed / AVG Gauge displays the vessel’s current velocity and average speed over time, offering a clear visual reference for performance tracking and navigation control. Its dual-value layout presents real-time speed data alongside a calculated average, allowing the operator to quickly assess propulsion stability and detect deviations from the expected cruising range.

            The gauge integrates readings from onboard sensors or GPS input to maintain accuracy under varying environmental conditions. When the autopilot is active, the indicator continues to update live speed data, ensuring the operator remains informed of propulsion behavior.

            Indicator colors convey operational status: white (neutral) signifies normal performance, yellow warns of parameters requiring attention, and red marks critical or unsafe values. Green is used only where the “good” condition can be explicitly confirmed by the system.

        <div class="coach-text">
            The RPM Gauge indicates the current revolutions per minute of the vessel’s propulsion system. It provides a direct visual link between throttle input and engine response, helping the operator maintain optimal engine load and detect irregularities in propulsion behavior.

            The gauge continuously receives live data from the engine controller or onboard sensors, ensuring real-time feedback even during rapid acceleration or deceleration. This allows quick detection of underperformance, overspeed, or unstable operating zones.

            Indicator colors represent system condition: white (neutral) indicates nominal operation, yellow signals abnormal load or unstable RPM, and red denotes a critical overrun or mechanical risk. Green is used only when the engine is operating within an efficiency-verified range.

            The Engine Temperature Gauge monitors the thermal state of the propulsion system and alerts the operator to overheating risks. It provides continuous feedback under both manual control and autopilot. Indicator colors convey status: white (neutral) means the temperature is within the normal operating band; yellow signals a value that requires attention (trend up or sustained high load); red denotes a critical overheat condition or immediate risk to the engine. Green is used only where the system can explicitly confirm a “good” condition (e.g., verified warm-up complete).

            The Rudder Angle Indicator shows current helm deflection relative to the vessel’s centerline. Tick marks are calibrated from –35° (PORT) to +35° (STBD) with a neutral 0° reference at midline. The white pointer rotates in real time to reflect actual rudder feedback, enabling the operator to verify steering response at a glance. Use the neutral line to confirm straight-ahead tracking; sustained offset indicates a compensating helm input (e.g., wind or current). In manual steering, the pointer follows physical helm movement; under autopilot, it reflects commanded deflection while still displaying live sensor feedback. White scale marks indicate nominal range; use this gauge to validate that commanded turns and settling behavior match expectations after course changes.

                The Radar control manages power to the vessel’s radar system. In its default state, the indicator shows Off, meaning the radar transmitter and display stack are inactive.

                Tapping On powers up the radar and switches the control to its active state. The button highlights to confirm that the radar is energized and transmitting.
                
                Tapping Off safely shuts the system down and returns the control to standby, preventing further scans until re-activated.

                This control provides a clear, deliberate on/off workflow to avoid unintended radar transmission.

Selecting a mode updates the button label and sends the corresponding command to the autopilot controller, clearly indicating whether the vessel is under manual steering or automated control.

                Autopilot Mode Definitions:

                Manual — The vessel is steered directly by the operator with no autopilot stabilization.
                
                Hold — Maintains the current heading or rudder position for basic course stabilization.
                                
                Auto — Follows a commanded course or navigation plan, applying continuous steering corrections.
                                
                Loiter — Circles a fixed point in a slow, controlled orbit for station-keeping or waiting.
                                
                Acro — Provides direct, rate-based steering with minimal stabilization for advanced operators.

            <div class="coach-text">
                The Trim Tab control balances the hull side-to-side using the port and starboard tabs. Each vertical slider sets a tab’s deflection from +7 (tab up) through 0 (neutral) to −7 (tab down), with fills showing how far you’ve moved from center. You can drag the thumb directly or use the ▲/▼ nudge buttons for precise adjustments; all values are constrained to the displayed range.

                A live roll indicator above the sliders visualizes how tab adjustments affect hull attitude: the boat illustration tilts dynamically as you change either side, and the numeric roll readout updates in real time. This feedback loop lets you see the vessel “react” to your inputs, helping you level the boat quickly and reduce heel under load or uneven weight distribution.

                The Anchor control manages how much rode you pay out and shows your holding setup at a glance. Opening it reveals a vertical slider from Up/0 down to 60 m; drag the thumb or use the ▲/▼ nudge buttons to lower or raise the line. As you adjust, both the rode length readout and the mini gauge under the boat icon update in real time.

                A built-in depth display shows your current water depth, so you can immediately judge how much rode you need for safe anchoring.

                Use the scope selector to choose a target ratio (4:1 or 7:1). The interface highlights how close you are to that target, helping you match rode length to depth for reliable holding. Adjust gradually and follow the live indicators to avoid overpaying line or drifting outside your intended scope.
